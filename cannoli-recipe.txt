Cannoli Siciliani has to be, in my opinion, the ultimate Italian pastry.
The shells should be covered in bubbles to give you the most amazing crispy
texture. The filling is absolutely divine! How could you go wrong with silky,
whipped ricotta speckled with mini chocolate chips?  Sprinkle with icing sugar
and you are ready to indulge in one of the best Italian Pastries. More about it:
